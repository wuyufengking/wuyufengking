# About me


- I enjoy running and coding.
- I'm a beginner level ACMer.
- In terms of technical skills, I have a basic understanding of the syntax of c, c++, javascript, css, and html, and I don't know anything else.
- “The difference between a beginner and a master is that the master has failed more times than the beginner has ever tried.”
